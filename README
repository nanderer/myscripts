this are some scripts i written myself to do things more easily on my laptop, you can create them in your ~/bin or /.local/bin directory and if your .bashrc and/or .profile includes some export PATH=$PATH:~/bin or so (default on debian) they will be available wherever you can enter commands ;)

don't forget do do a chmod +x for them to work...

any comments, feel free to open an issue...

happy Hacking!

PS: you'll need xprop and amixer for them to work, thanks captain obvious but you know somebody will ask if you don't write stuff like this...
